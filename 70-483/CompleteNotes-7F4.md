Scales processes to use the processor most efficiently.  Benefits of using Tasks: More efficient and more scalable use of system resources						 More programmatic control than is possible with a thread or work item.### Data ParallelismData parallelism - The Scenario in which the same operation is performed concurrently on elements in a source collection or array.  Portions of the collections are segregated off so each thread can access it without disturbing the others.Part of ```System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel``````Parallel.For``` and ```Parallel.ForEach``` handle data parallelism.### Task ParallelismThe TPL is based on the concept of a task, which represents an asynchonous operation.  A task resembles a thread or ThreadPool but at a higher level of abstraction.Task Parallelism refers to one or more independent tasks running concurrently. #### Creating and Running Tasks ImplicitlyParallel.Invoke method is quick way to run a statement concurently. Pass an Action Delegate or anonymous method to start.```C#Parallel.Invoke(() => DoWork(), () => DoMoreWork());```#### Creating and Running Tasks ExplicitlySystem.Threading.Tasks.Task are Tasks that do not return anything.System.Threading.Tasks.Task<TResult> are Tasks that return a value.Task.Status will return whether the Task has run or not.Task.Status is returned as a TaskStatus enumeration.Tasks are passed delegates to ecapsulate code.Task.Wait() tells the program to wait for the task's complete before exiting.```C#using System;using System.Threading;using System.Threading.Tasks;public class Examples{	public static void Main()	{		Thread.CurrentThread.Name = "Main";		Task taskA = new Task(() => Console.WriteLine("hello from taskA"));		taskA.Start();	}}```To create and run a task in one command use the Task.Run(() => DoSomething()); method.#### Parallel.ForSystem.Threading.TasksParallel.For executes a for loop that runs each loop on a different thread.How to use.```C#var r = Parallel.For(int start, int stop, (i, state) => {});var r = Parallel.For(int start, int stop, (i) => {});```#### Parallel.ForEachForeach loop that runs parallel.```C#Parallel.ForEach(enumerablecollection, delegate);Parallel.ForEach(enumerablecollection, () => {	DoSomething();});```### Dataflow## PLINQ#### What is a Parallel Query## Tasks and TaskFactories```Task``` and ```TaskFactory``` are used to create and manage tasks. Task is robust but still doesn't provide as many options as TaskFacotry. TaskFactory is clunky because of the options.### TaskExamples of running tasks```C#//creates a task and starts it.Task newtask = Task(() => {	DoSomething();});newtask.Start();### TaskFactory## Locks, Deadlocks, and Race Conditions### Race ConditionRace conditions occure when more than one thread is trying to access a shared variable at the same time.Two or more threads take in the same variable and output to the same variable. It's a race to who's last. Each thread will overwrite the last.### DeadlocksDeadlocks occur when two or more threads try to lock a resource the other has already locked. Neither thread can make any furhter progress.Many methods of the managed threading classes provide time-outs to help you detect deadlocks.```C#if(Monitor.TryEnter(lockObject, 300)) {	try {		//code that will run if the monitor locks	}	finally {		Monitor.Exit(this);	}else{		//code that will run if the monitor doesn't lock	}}```### lockThe ```lock``` keyword marks a statement block as a critical section.By locking a block of code it will make sure it cannot execute while another locked thread is accessing a shared resource.```C#class lock_example{	object locthis;	public void Go()	{		Task.Run(()=>{			loc(new Object())			{				locthis = new Object {Tag = "this"};			}		});		Task.Tun(()=>{			loc(new Object())			{				locthis = new Object {Tag = "that"};			}		});	}}```The bottom thread will wait for the top thread to finish before turning locthis into a new object with the Tag Property of "that".# Control Statements## if/else**if/else** statements help with decision making in program flow. If something is satisified do this else, do this.```C#if(variable == 0)	DoSomething();else	DoSomethingElse();```## while**while** loop until an outcome is satisfied. Will not run if already satisfied.```C#while (checkvar != "STOP!"){	checkvar = DoSomething();};```## do/while**Do/While** Loop until an outcome is satisfied. Will run atleast once no matter the outcome.```C#do{	checkvar = DoSomething();}while(checkvar != "STOP!");```## switch**switch** Similar to if used to satisfy multiple outcomes cleanly. Has ability for default for unexpected value.```C#switch(varcheck){	case "GO!":		DoSomething();		break;	case "STOP!"		DoSomethingElse();		break;	default:		Console.WriteLine("UNEXPECTED RESULT");		break;}```## for**for** loops are simple loops that will loop a set amount of times. loop.```C#for(int i = 0;i < 10;i++)	DoSomething();for(int i = 0; i < variable;i++)	DoSomething();```## foreach**foreach** loops through any object that inherites from the IEnumerable interface. These are collections of the same object type.```C#foreach(object o in objectcollection)	DoSomething(o);```passes each object in objectcollection to the DoSomething(object o) method.## break**break** forces your program out of a loop. The following is common.```C#while(true){	if(something == outcome)		break;}```this will continue to run until something and outcome equal the same.## continue**continue** allows the loop to continue.```C#while(true){	if(something == outcome)		continue;	else		break;}```this will continue until something and outcome do not equal the same.## goto**goto** can be used to move the code between tagged areas. This is similar to basic and batch. Tagged areas are written as ```Label:``` ```C#Goto10:	Console.WriteLine(""/Do you have an extra goto 10 line?"/ -Calculon");goto Goto10;```You can also use them in switch statements```C#switch (integer){	case 0:		goto case 10:		break;	case 1:		goto case 10:		break;	case 10:		Console.WriteLine("An actual 10 line to goto.");		break;}```## yieldReturns enumerated objects. Everytime the method with the yield return is called it will return the next yield.```C#public int ReturnNum(){	yield return 1;	yield return 2;	yield return 3;}```They can also be used for custom IEnumerable objects```C#class enumerableTest : IEnumerable{	public Enumerator GetEnumerator()	{		yield return 1;		yield return 2;		yield return 3;		yield return 4;	}}```This can now be used in a foreach loop because of the IEnumerable interface and the implementation of the ```GetEnumerator()``` method.## yield break and continue**yield break** allows you to break a loop within your enumerator.**yield continue** allows you to break a loop within an enumerator.## Enumerable.Range(int,int)Generates a quick enumerated set of integers between a set of numbers.# Events and Delegates## DelegatesDelegates hold methods as objects and allow you to invoke them at will.```C#public delegate void MyDelegate(string info);public MyDelegate delegatehandler;delegatehandler += MyNewMethod;public void MyNewMethod(string info){	Console.WriteLine(info);}```Whenever the delegatehandler is called it will execute the method passed to the delegate.### Func<T,U>```Func``` is a generic delegate that takes and input and returns an output.```C#public class functest{	public Func<string, string> concatfunc;	public functest()	{		concatfunc += concatmethod;	}	public void trigger()	{		string input = "First";		string inputoutput = "Second"		Console.WriteLine(concatfunc.Invoke(input, inputoutput));		Console.WriteLine(inputoutput);	}	public string concatmethod (string s, out string s2)	{		s2 += s;		return s + s2;	}}```This will output:FirstSecondSecondFirstThe last variable in Func is na out variable which means it updataes the variable a scope above that was passed to it.It also returns a what ever type you have set.The first call prints the return, but at the same time it updates inputoutput.This allows the second console.writeline code to print SecondFirst instead of just Second.### Action<t>Action is like func except it doesn't return anything, not even with ```out``` parameters.It can have a lot of input parameters though. Invoke the same way, don't expect any returns.## lambda Expressions/Anonymous MethodsLambda Expressions and Anonymous Methods are the same thing.You can create a lambda expression with the operator ``=>``You can use a lambda expression to define delegates, actions, funcs, events.```C#public class lambdatest{	//event that will hold our Lambda Expression	public Action event lambdatestevent;	//uses the lambda operator to create a get property.	public int ANumber => 5;	public lambdatest	{		lambdatestevent = () => {			Console.WriteLine("This is from the lambda expression");		};	}}```Whenever lambdatestevent is triggered it will run the lambda expression that is created on object instantiation.## Subscribing/Unsubscriping from eventsYou can subscribe with += and unsubscribe with -=```C#public event action thisevent;public void subscribe(Action act){	thisevent += act;}public void unsubscribe(Action act){	thisevent -= act;}```The above code allows you to subscribe and unsubscribe Action delegates from events using the += and -= operators.+= and -= actually access custom accessors available only to events ```add``` and ```remove```You can subscribe more than one method to a event/delegate/generic delegate and they will execute in order.# Create and Use Types## Reference TypesReference types return a memory reference.## Value TypesDerived from System.ValueType.Value types are types that return a value instead of a memory reference. When given a value you cannot modify the value like reference objects.Can not inherit from value types.Values can be assigned null if declared nullable.All integrals inherit from System.Int32.### structThe ```struct``` declaration is similar to a class in that it stores data and can execute methods. Structs though only return values instead of references.structs must have all their public properties and fields initialized during the struct initialization. This is because you cannot modify information in a struct.In order to declare new information in a struct you have to make a new one. ```C#public struct struct_example{	public int X;	public int Y => 25	public int Z;	//x is required as an argument because X is not initialized by the constructor or during instantiation.	public struct_example(int x)	{		Z = 10;		X = x;	}}```Structs fall into the followiung#### Numeric TypesStructs hold numerical data, integrals, floats, decimals  Structs also hold bools  Structs can have user defined values### enum```enum``` is a value that declares a keyword assigned to a number (or other types).```C#public enum NewEnum {val1, val2, val3}public enum NewEnum2 {val1 = 10, val2 = 5, val3 = 0}```You can declare an enum with default values like in the first example. In this example val1 = 0, val2 = 1, val3 = 2.  You can also declare enums with custom values like in second example.You can also declare your enum as a different data type to store different information.```C#public enum NewEnum3 : float {val1 = .5, val2 = .25 val3 = 0;}```Enums can also be cast between their value class and their enum class.```int ex1 = NewEnum.val2;  //1int ex2 = NewEnum2.val1;  //10float ex3 = NewEnum3.val3; //0NewEnum ne = NewEnum.val1;NewEnum2 ne2 = NewEnum.val3;NewEnum3 ne3 = NewEnum.val2;ne = (NewEnum)2; //NewEnum.val3ne2 = (NewENum2)10 //NewEnum2.val1ne3 = (NewEnum3).25 //NewEnum.val2```## MethodsMethods are blocks of codes within a class or struct that execute on variables that are passed into them or local variables within the class.```C#public class method_example{	public void method()	{		...	}}```### Optional ParametersOptional Parameters are predefined parameters in a method. They must come at the end of all requires variables.If they are not referenced in the call they will use the default value provided.```C#public void optionalexample(int i, int j, string optional = "optional"){ ... }public void Main(){	//Don't have to declare	ExampleClass.optionalexample(1,2);	//But can	ExampleClass.optoinalexample(1,2,"not optional");}```### Named ParametersYou can name parameters during instantiation. You can apply parameters in any order when doing so.```C#void method(int i, int j, int x) { ... }void Main(){	method(j : 1, x :  5, i: 2);}```### Static Extension MethodsYou can extend objects by creating a static method that references it's first parameter with this```C#public static int Sigma(this int x){	int newx = 0;	for(int i = 0; i <= x; i++ )		newx += x * i;	return newx;}void Main(){	Console.WriteLine(5.Sigma());	int sigmatest = 20;	Console.WriteLine(sigmatest.Sigma());}```,Sigma is now a method available to all Integer type classes because the first parameter is this, refering to it's self as an int.static extention methods must be created in a static class.## IndexersAnytime you reference information like this ```[]``` you are using an indexer.You can add indexers to any objects.```C#public object this [int]{	get { return indexedobject[i]; }    set { indexedobject[i] = value; }}```The this command references the object this Property belongs to. This defines the [] part to this and defines how it functions.## Static VariablesStatic variables (and classes and methods) are instantiated on runtime. They are globally accessible. This is a great way for shared assets.```C#public class newobject{	private static _id = 0;	public string ID {get;set;}	public newobject()	{		ID = "REF" + _id;		_id++;	}}```Above uses a ```static``` variable to assign an ID numbers. The ```_id``` variable will be the same across all ```newobject``` objects because it is declared static.the ```_id++``` updates the variable so the next created ```newobject``` ID will be incremented by 1.Static Variables can also be used to access information between objects and threads```C#public class StaticVariableAndMethod{	public static Dictionary<string, Queue<string>> taskqueue = new Dictionary<string, Queue<string>>();	public static string CheckForUpdate(string idnum)	{		string nextcomm = taskqueue[idnum].Peak();		taskqueue[idnum].dequeue();		return nextcomm;	}}```The following block of code can be used to share messages for objects with particular idnumbers. Both the variable and the method can be access as:```C#//To access the static variable taskqueue;StaticVariableAndMethod.taskqueue;//To access the static method CheckForUpdateStaticVariableAndMethod.CheckForUpdate(objectwithid.ID);```## InterfacesInterfaces are a type of inheritable object. Public members are defined within an Interface but no code to execute.Classes that inherit from an interface must implement each members of the interface publicly.Interfaces are basically a contract in which you agree that a particular class will conform to.The major use is polymorphism and satisfying the Liskov Substitution Principle from SOLID.```C#public interface IInterfeceTest{	int AnInteger { get; set; }	int GetInteger();}public class newclass : IInterfaceTest{	int _aint = 0;	public int AnInteger { get { return _aint; } set { _aint = value; } }	public int GetInteger()	{		return _aint;	}}```You can inherit from as many interfaces as you need and it is recommended to split up interfaces into a small and few as possible. This is the Interface Segregation Principle of SOLID.The above code confirms to the IInterfaceTest members. You can hold any child class in the object of it's interface```C#public class anotherclass : IInterfaceTest{	...}int Main(){	IInterfaceTest iit = new newclass();	iit = new anotherclass();}```### Member SignaturesThe signature of a member is the name and any argumnents that can be provided.```C#public void method() { ... }public void method(int i) { ... }```These are entirely differenty methods because their signature is different. Parameters are part of the signature. Their paremters are different. Therefore different method.This can apply to constructors by name and parametersIndexers by assigning different variables to index.Opterators but that's not really important.### Overloaded MembersAn overloaded members is a member of an object that is named the same but have a different signature.```C#public void overload_method(int i) { ... }public void overload_method(int i, int j) { ... }```Both methods above have the same name but are legal. overload_method is overloaded because when you accept different parameters the method has a different signature so it can exist on it's own.## Base Classes### Abstract base classesAbstract classes are similar to interfaces in that they cannot be instantiated, they outline required methods and properties in classes that inherit it,and they can be used for polymorphism. But ```abstract``` classes can contain complete inheritable methods and properties that can be used by derived classes.```C#public abstract class abstractexample{	//must be overriden	public abstract int Property {get;set;}	//can be overriden	public virtual int Property2 {get;set;}	//cannot be overriden but can be accessed	public int Property3 {get;set;}	//the same works for methods	//Must be overridden, no code can be written for abstract.	public abstract int GetNumber();	//Can be overridden, code must be provided.	public virtual int GetNumber2() { return 1; }	//Cannot be overridden but can be accessed.	public int GetNumber3() { return 2; }}public class inheritabstract : abstractexample{	//override property.	public override int Property {get {return 2} set {value} };	//override class is required.	public override int GetNumber()	{		return 5;	}	//override, but didn't have to.	public override GetNumber2()	{		return 7;	}}```The above code uses the ```virtual``` and ```abstract``` method modifiers to determine how they will be handled with derived classes.**virtual** - is a method modifier that allows a derived class to ```override``` it and use it's own code.**abstract** - defines a signature for a property or method but does not supply any code. Derived classes must ```override``` this class.Any method or property not merked with a modifier are inherited and can be executed by the derived class, but the derived class cannot ```override``` them.### Overridden MembersOverriden Members are members of a class that are inherited and marked as ```abstract``` or ```virtual```**virtual** - virtual denotes that a class can be overridden but is not required to be. This class can be fully defined.**abstract** - abstract denotes that a class must be overridden. Abstract methods and properties are never defined and abstract classes cannot be instantiated.```C#public abstract class abstractexamples{	public void abstract runthis();	public void virtual runthistoo()	{		Console.WriteLine("this is running")	}}public class abstractinherit : abstractexamples{	public void override runthis()	{		Console.WriteLine("This is now a declared method.")	}}int Main(){	abstractinherit ah = new abstractinherit();	ah.runthis();	ah.runthistoo();}```# LINQLanguage-Integrated Query - LINQ - Introduced in .Net 3.5Must be used against Strongly Typed collectionsLINQ is a unified model for querying any IEnumerable or IEnumerable<T> in a safe manner.LINQ to Objects is the name for LINQ queries in memory.Can be used to query SQL Server, XML Documents, ADO.NET Datasets, IEnumerable or IEnumerable<T>.## Basic LINQ QueriesQuery is an expression that retieves data from a data source. LINQ simplifies queries between languages.<ol>	<il>Obtain the data source.</il>	<il>Create the query.</il>	<il>Execute the query.</il></ol>### Query ExampleExample calls an array which executes foreach to query the information.Foreach can only be executed on objects that inherit from IEnumerable, Ienumerable<T>, IQueryable<T> or any derived interface.Classes that inherit from those interfaces are called Queryable Types.LINQ natively supports Queriable Types.```C#class foo{	static void main()	{		//1. The data source.		int[] numbers = new int[7] {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}		//2. Query creation		var numQuery = from num in numbers					   where (num & 2) == 0					   select num;		//3. Query Execution		foreach(int num in numQuery)			Console.Write("{0,1}", num);	}}```### Data SourceThe above example is LINQ To Object against an array.You can also use Linq to XML```C#//Data sourceXElement xmldata = XElement.Load(@"C:\Path\To\File.xml");```LINQ to SQL requires an object-relational mappting at design time.This can be done manually or by using hte Object Relational Designer.You write your queries against objects and LINQ to SQL builds the objects from the database at runtime.LINQ to SQLThe following assumes there is a table called customers imported to an object that holds the data called Northwnd db.```C#Northwnd db = new Northwnd(@"C:\northwnd.mdf");// submit queryIQueryable<Customer> custQuery = from cust in db.Customers								 where cust.City == "London"								 select cust;```A LINQ data source is any object that inherits the generic IEnumerable<T> interface or any interface that derives from it.### The QueryQueries are stored in a query variable and initialized with a query expressionThe query doesn't actually run until the data is accessed.## Deferred ExecutionQuery is not run until data is acessed```C#//The queryvar result = from foo in bar			 where (foo.foobar == true)			 select foo;//When the query is executed.foreach(foo in result)	DoSomething(foo);```Using IEnumerable properties like Count, Max, and Average run the query, but only return the value requested.```C#//returns the count, not the query, still runs query.int count = Query.Count();```To force immediate execution you can always you can call ToList() or ToArray()```C#List<int> query1 = //or int[] query1	(from num in numbers	 where (num % 2) == 0	 select num).ToList(); // or ToArray()```## LINQ and Generic Types```C#IEnumerable<Customer> query = //LINQ query...```Query returns a list of objects called customer.Compiler can handle it with var```C#var query = //LINQ query...```## Basic LINQ Query Operations### Documentation<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397927(v=vs.110).aspx">Microsoft Basic LINQ Query Operations</a><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb311040(v=vs.110).aspx">Microsoft Join clause documentation</a>### Obtaining a Data Sourcefrom defines the range variable (range of data)in defines the data source```C#from cust in customers```Additional range variables can be added with the ```let``` clause.### FilteringUsing the ```where``` clause allows you to specify content.```C#where cust.City == "London"```Using the and and or operators work just like c#```C#where cust.City == "London" && cust.Name == "Bob"where cust.City == "London" || cust.Name == "Bob"```### Orderinguse the ```orderby``` clause to sort.```orderby cust.Name ascending```### GroupingThe ```group``` clause enables you to gorup your results based on a key that you specify.example: group by city so all cities are in a group.```C#// queryCustomerByCity is an Ienumerable<IGrouping<string, Customer>>var queryCustomerByCity =	from cust in customers	group cust by cust.City;	foreach(var customerGroup in queryCustomerByCity)	{		Console.WriteLine(CustomerGroup.Key)		foreach(Customer customer in customerGroup)			Console.WriteLine("     {0}", customer.Name);	}```When you use the ```group``` clause your reults take the form of a list of lists.You must use a nested foreach to iterate these. AboveIf you must refer to the result of a group operation you can use the into keyword to create an identify that can be queried further.```C#group cust by cust.City into custGroup```### JoiningJoining allows you to create associations between sequence that are not explicitly modeled in the data sources.In LINQ ```join``` clause always works against object collections instead of database tables directly.```C#var innerJoinQuery =	from cust in customers	join dist in distributors on cust.City equals dist.City	select new { CustomerName = cust.Name, DistributorName = dist.Name };```### Group Joina ```join``` clause with an ```into``` clause```C#var innerGroupJoinQuery =	from category in categories	join prod in products on category.ID equals prod.CategoryID into prodGroup	select new { CategoryName = category.Name, Products = prodGroup };```### Left Outer JoinUse the ```DefaultIfEmpty()``` method in combination with a group join```C#var leftOuterJoinQuery =	from category in categories	join prod in products on category.ID equals prod.CategoryID into prodGroup	from item in prodGroup.DefaultIfEmpty(new Product { Name = String.Empty, CategoryID = 0 })	select new { CatName = category.Name, ProdName = item.Name };```### The Equals OperatorA ```join``` clause performas an equijoin this means you can only base matches on the equality of two keys.greater than and not equals are not supportedjoin uses ```equal``` to make sure there isn't confusion between other C# operators.### Non-EquijoinsYou can perform non-equijoins, cross joins,a nd other custom join operations by using the ```from``` clause### Joins on object collections vs relation tablesjoin is only necessary when joining objects that are not modeledLINQ to SQL stores the primary and seconadary key tables in the object### Composite KeysYou can test for equality of multiple values by using a composite key.## Data Transformation with LINQ<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397914(v=vs.110).aspx">Microsoft Data Transformations with LINQ Documentation</a>Can transform data<ul>	<li>Merge multiple input sequences into a single output sequence that has a new type.</li>	<li>Create output sequences whose elements consist of only one or several properties of each element in the source sequence.</il>	<li>Create output sequences who elements conssit of the results of operations perform on the source data.</li>	<li>Create output sequence in a different format. For example, you can transform data from SQL rows or test files into XML.</li></ul>###Joining Multiple Inputs into One Output Sequence Example```C#//Data classesclass Student{	public string First { get; set; }	public string Last { get; set; }	public int ID { get; set; }	public string Street { get; set; }	public string City { get; set; }	public List<int> Scores { get; set; }}class Teacher{    public string First { get; set; }    public string Last { get; set; }    public int ID { get; set; }     public string City { get; set; }}class DataTransformation{	static void Main()	{        // Create the first data source.
